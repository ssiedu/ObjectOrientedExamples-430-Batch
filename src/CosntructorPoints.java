/*
1) its a method like body having same name as their class and no return type
    (not even void also)(access modifiers are allowed)
2) it may or may not have parameters. (varargs are allowed)
3) it can be overloaded also.
4) constructors are implicitly invoked during object creation.
    where as you need to call a method for its execution.
5)  when you do not write any constructor from your side, one zero arg
     constructor is internally provided by java, which is called default        constructor.
6) once we write our own constructor, default will lost.
    (but if you want you can create your own no-arg consturctor)
7) they are used to define the initial state of an object.
    (they are used to intialize the members of an object during its creation only)

	constructors defines only initial state,
	later on state can be changed by calling methods.
8) constructor can be called once only in the life cycle of an object,
    where as a method can be called any times.
9) java do not support copy-constructor.
    (copy-constructors are used for creating clone objects)
	java provides a method for creating a clone object
	name of that method is clone()
	this method is available in Object class.
